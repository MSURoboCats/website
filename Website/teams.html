        <h2>ELECTRICAL TEAM</h2>
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <p>The electrical team works to ensure proper connectivity and power distribution to all components of the AUV.
                This requires regular wiring maintenance and system planning in order to keep every electrical interface functioning as intended.
                The electrical team also helps develop all new projects involving electrical engineering in some form.
            </p>
